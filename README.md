# Stepic

This is a package is based on [Stepic](http://domnit.org/stepic/doc/) but the original version only works for Python 2. Therefore, I made some modification to let it work for Python 3.

## Install

```shell
cd this_folder
```

```shell
python setup.py install
```

## Run Demo

```shell
cd demo
```

```shell
python demo.py
```

Thanks for the author of Stepic really much because [his method](http://domnit.org/blog/2007/02/stepic-explanation.html) to do steganography really inspires me a lot.
